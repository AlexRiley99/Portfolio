              This project started as a practical way to organize the 
              growing number of books in my home. I wanted a simple, 
              functional tool that was customizable and easy to update. 
              Building it gave me the opportunity to strengthen my skills 
              in Java and JDBC while applying core software development 
              concepts like CRUD operations, user input validation, and 
              database interaction.

          <h3>How to Use</h3>
          <p>
            To use the book catalog, simply run the program and it will open up in
            the terminal. From there, navigation is done by selecting a number from 
            lists of options, or by selecting Y/N to respond to yes/no prompts.

          <div class="developmentSteps">
            <ol>
              <li class="stepNumber">Set Up The Repository</li>
              <p class="solidBg">
              I created the repository in GitHub and cloned it in VS Code so
              that I could use GitHub for version control. 
              </p>
              <li class="stepNumber">Set Up Database</li>
              <p class="solidBg">
                I downloaded the appropriate JDBC driver to allow my Java application 
                to communicate with the database. Next, I created a CreateDatabase utility 
                class that establishes the initial SQLite database file (bookcatalog.db). 
                Running this class ensures the database exists before the application starts. 
                For ongoing database operations, I implemented a DatabaseHelper class responsible 
                for connecting to the database and performing database-related functionalities using 
                methods with prepared SQL statements.
              </p>
              <li class="stepNumber">Development</li>
              <p class="solidBg">
                Initially, I was developing everything inside of one big do...while loop, but 
                I soon realized that this was not sustainable or dynamic. Instead, I opted to 
                make every functionality of the program into its own method. The Main Menu is a 
                method, which, based on the user's input, calls other methods. Each method (which I 
                named Create(), Read(), Update(), and Delete() after CRUD operations) contains two do...while
                loops. 
              <br><br>
                The first do...while contains an if...else statement to perform tasks based on user input. 
                The second do...while loop handles user continuation. After completing an action (like adding 
                or searching for a book), it asks whether the user wants to perform the task again. If yes, the 
                method is called again. If no, a Return() method is called, to ask the user 
                whether they want to return to the Main Menu. If yes, MainMenu() is called. If no, the 
                terminal prints "Goodbye!" and the program ends. 
              <br><br>
                I chose to use do...while loops for most of the operations because of how much user input the program requires. 
                Using a do...while loop allows the program to prompt the user for input, take the input to perform functions,
                and then cease functions when the while condition is met, or re-prompt the user if an invalid input is entered.

            The ability to search for books using keywords. This would allow the user to search for specific
            topics, sequels to other books, etc. in addition to searching by title, author, etc. the way one is
            currently able to.
