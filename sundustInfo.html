              This is a website that I built for Derek Riley, a freelance
              photographer (and also my husband). It is a professional website
              to help attract customers, allow them to see his work, and allow
              them to book a session easily. It includes a Home page, an About
              page, a Gallery page, and a Pricing page.

                <li>
                  A "Book Now" button, which opens up an email draft addressed

                <li>
                  A changing image in the center, which loops through 5 images.
                  Clicking the image takes the user to the Gallery page.
                </li>
              </ul>
              The Home page, provides nice examples of past work, a clear travel
              range, and a quick and easy way for customers to get in contact.

              <p>Key <b>About Page</b> Features:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A few paragraphs about who he is and why he does photography

              </ul>
              <p>
                The About page contains information all about who Derek is and
                why he chose to get into photography. It provides a sense of
                personality, like there's a real human on the other end of this
                website, and allows the customer to get a feel for who they're
                hiring. The bottom of the page includes contact details (phone
                number and business email) to, again, allow the customer to
                quickly and easily get in contact.

              <p>Key <b>Gallery Page</b> Features:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A Jump To section that allows the user to skip to any
                  category. This is helpful because it saves the user from
                  having to scroll down past dozens of images.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A To Top button that takes the user back to the top of the
                  page, so they may choose a different section to visit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Images that expand when clicked and shrink back down when a
                  close button is clicked.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Gallery page was my favorite to develop and I'm very proud
                of it. It includes all sorts of examples of his work, divided
                into 5 categories: Events, Animals, Nature, Manmade, and People.
                Clicking on any section title in the "Jump To" section will skip
                to that section. I added this so that if someone, for example,
                wants to view the Nature section, they don't have to scroll
                through two other sections to get there. Similarly, I added a
                "To Top" button to bring the user back to the top of the page to
                select another section, rather than scrolling all the way back
                up. This streamlines and improves the experience for the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each image in the Gallery page is clickable and clicking on any
                image will expand it so that it can be seen more closely or
                viewed on its own without the visual clutter of the other
                images. When an image is expanded, a close button also appears,
                to allow the user to shrink the image back down and keep
                scrolling. Hovering over an image shows a white box-shadow to
                let the user know that it's a clickable item.

              <p>Key <b>Pricing Page</b> Features:</p>

                  Pricing for different packages and categories of photos

              </ul>
              <p>
                The pricing page clearly outlines the different photo and
                session packages that are available, as well as their pricing.
                This provides some transparency to the customer and streamlines
                the experience because they don't have to do any extra legwork
                to obtain the information. The customer can see right away
                whether Sundust Photography is within their budget. The Pricing
                page also includes a list of promo codes that can be used when
                booking an appointment.

                <li>
                  Background is a radial gradient, intended to look like a ring
                  of light. Background uses warm inviting colors and is a
                  semi-transparent gradient over an image of film grain, for
                  texture.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Text and buttons are a shade of blue that compliments the

                <li>
                  Hovering over a button causes it to transition to a lighter
                  shade of blue. Clicking on a button does the same.

        <div class="developmentSteps">
          <ol>
            <li class="stepNumber">Set Up The Repository & Domain</li>
            <p class="whiteBackground">
              I created the repository in GitHub and cloned it in VS Code so
              that I could use GitHub for version control. GitHub Pages is also
              my chosen hosting platform for this website, as it's free,
              enforces HTTPS, and allows me to update my website directly from
              the repository. The domain was bought via Network Solutions and is
              hosted as a custom domain in GitHub pages.
            </p>
            <li class="stepNumber">Gather Requirements</li>
            <p class="whiteBackground">
              I spoke with the client to determine what he wants to see in his
              website. He used words like "cozy" and "neighborly" to describe
              the feel he wanted the site to have. We also discussed which pages
              he would want on the website and what sorts of functionalities he
              wants it to have.
            </p>
            <li class="stepNumber">Design</li>
            <p class="whiteBackground">
              First, I looked up some mood boards on Pinterest, using keywords
              like "cozy" and "neighborly". Next, I used Google color picker to
              find some hex codes for colors that I would potentially use for
              this project, based on the mood boards. I decided on the sepia and
              blue color scheme because it has a cozy vibe and the blue really
              compliments the orange in the sepia.
            </p>
            <p class="whiteBackground">
              Next, I put together some wireframes to show to the client, to get
              his approval on the layout of the pages. I also showed him the
              color scheme and used Google Fonts to choose some fonts together.
            </p>
            <li class="stepNumber">Front End</li>
            <p class="whiteBackground">
              I began by creating HTML files for each page of the website. Then,
              I created corresponding CSS files and one overarching Styles.css
              file. Styles.css handles styles that apply to the entire website,
              such as the background and button colors. The CSS files for each
              page only handles styles that are specific to that page.
            </p>
            <p class="whiteBackground">
              Next, I pasted in HTML boilerplate code from a boilerplate.html
              file that I keep on my device for when I want to create a new HTML
              file. It saves me from typing out the same things over and over
              again to create the basic structure of an HTML page.
            </p>
            <p class="whiteBackground">
              Once each page had its boilerplate code, I went through and added
              actual elements to each page such as text, buttons, image boxes,
              etc. I styled each element as it was created, as this is my
              preferred method.
            </p>
            <li class="stepNumber">Back End</li>
            <p class="whiteBackground">
              The back end for this website mainly consists of JavaScript for
              the Gallery page. I had never created an expanding image effect
              like this in JavaScript before. I had created one in Kotlin
              before, for an Android app assignment in college, but never for a
              website. Since this was new territory, I began by researching how
              to do it.
            </p>
            <p class="whiteBackground">
              Once I had consulted a few resources online, I began using a
              combination of CSS and JavaScript to produce the expanding image
              effect and the close button that appears when the image is
              expanded.
            </p>
            <p class="whiteBackground">
              JavaScript is also used to create the changing image on the Home
              page, cycling through an array of images and changing every 3
              seconds. There is an event listener on the image container so that
              when the image is clicked, it takes the user to the Gallery page.
