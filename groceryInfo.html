              This is a web application that allows one to set a budget amount 
              and then create and manage a grocery list based on that budget 
              amount. I developed it because I saw an opportunity to solve a 
              real-life problem. I manage all of the budgeting, meal planning, 
              and grocery list making for my household. Previously, I would 
              write my budget amount at the top of a sheet of paper, write my 
              list and how much I expected each item to cost, and then use a 
              calculator to add it all up. If I was over budget, I needed to 
              erase or cross things off and modify the list by hand until I was 
              on budget. Since this was as tedious as it sounds, I decided that 
              I would use my coding expertise to make my life easier.

        <!--STEPS-->
        <p class="sectionSubHeading">Steps to Use:</p>
        <div class="stepsContainer">
          <div class="stepsToUse whiteBackground">
            <!--Set Budget-->
            <p class="stepNumber">Step 1.</p>
                Enter a budget amound and click "Set Budget" to lock it in. 
                This number can be changed at any time by entering a new number 
                and clicking "Set Budget" again. The budget amount is displayed 
                in the "Your List" section.
            </p>
            </div>

              alt="Setting the budget amount"
              class="screenshot"
              loading="lazy">
              <!--Begin Adding List Items-->
              <div class="stepsToUse whiteBackground">
                <p class="stepNumber">Step 2.</p>
                    Add items to the list by entering the item's name, quantity, and 
                    expected price. It's important to enter the expected price of one
                    item, even if buying multiple, because the backend does calculations
                    based on the price of one item. Once an item has been entered, click "Add"
                    to add it to the list. Then, the item is displayed in the "Your List"
                    section.
                </p>
                </div>

                  <div class="stepsToUse whiteBackground">
                    <p class="stepNumber">Step 3.</p>
                        Once finished adding list items, click "Done" to perform calculations. 
                        A message will tell one whether they're over budget, under budget, or right 
                        on budget. If the total cost is undesirable, or if one messed up part of their list,
                        the "Edit" button can be clicked to open the editor and make changes.
                    </p>

                    <!--Editor-->
                    <div class="stepsToUse whiteBackground">
                      <p class="stepNumber">Step 4.</p>
                          If needed, open the editor by clicking the "Edit" button. This allows the user to select an 
                          item by its item number on the list and either replace or remove the item. Here, I've chosen to 
                          replace my copious amounts of expensive bananas with just a couple of bananas for 50 cents each.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This works by accessing the grocery list item in the array of items and replacing its values. Then, 
                        calculations are reperformed. If removing an item, the "Remove" button can be selected and the item
                        disappears from the list. One can click the "Edit Another" button to keep editing 
                        until one is satisfied with their list.

                            Once done editing, the new list can be viewed, displaying a new total
                            and, if one's budget status has changed, a new message. Here, choosing
                            not to buy such an obscene amount of luxury $10 bananas put me under budget.

              <p class="whiteBackground">
                I created the repository in GitHub and cloned it in VS Code so
              that I could use GitHub for version control. GitHub Pages is also
              my chosen hosting platform for this website, as it's free,
              enforces HTTPS, and allows me to update my website directly from
              the repository. This web application uses GitHub Pages' default URL.

              <li class="stepNumber">Design</li>
              <p class="whiteBackground">
                With this originally being developed in May 2024, when I was just getting
                started with web design, the original design wasn't ideal. However, after honing my skills 
                a bit more, I came back and gave it a little makeover. I added a 
                paper grain texture to add to the "grocery list" theme and used a semi-transparent
                beige gradient over top. Buttons were all changed to be the same shade of chocolate brown.
                The color felt fitting, as it compliments the rest of the design and fits with the food theme.
                The background is an image of a grocery store produce section. I also use a font that looks like 
                handwriting in the "Your List" section.

                The front end was the easy part, using HTML and CSS to code and style forms for the user to enter their information. 
                On the back end, I pushed myself out of my comfort zone (my comfort zone at the time of development), using JavaScript
                to code all of the functionalities and calculations.
